**based on 《oprating system : three easy piece》**
**Hence the role of the OS as a resource manager.**
## Introduction
### Virtualizing the CPU
* time sharing
### Virtualizing Memory
* space sharing
>Indeed, that is exactly what is happening here as the OS is virtualizing memory. Each process accesses its own private virtual address space(sometimes just called its address space)

### Concurrency
### persistent
### Design Goal
>One of the most basic goals is to build up some abstractions in order to make the system convenient and easy to use. 
>One goal in designing and implementing an operating system is to
 provide high performance; another way to say this is our goal is to minimize the overheads of the OS
> Another goal will be to provide protection between applications, aswell as between the OS and applications.

### Abstraction Of Process
#### Intro
* def of process
>The definition of a process, informally, is quite simple: it is a running program [V+65,B70].
* 在进行CPU虚拟化后，不断的切换会导致运行速度下降
>. This basic technique, known as time sharing of the CPU, allows users to run as many concurrent processes as they would like; the potential cost is performance, as each will run more slowly if the CPU(s) must be shared.
* 采用两级的策略来使得cpu正常运行
>To implement virtualization of the CPU, and to implement it well, the
OS will need both some low-level machinery as well as some high-level
intelligence.
* 策略将考虑以下元素
>A scheduling policy in the OS will make this decision, likely using historical information (e.g., which program has run more over the last minute?),
workload knowledge (e.g., what types of programs are run), and performance metrics (e.g., is the system optimizing for interactive performance,or throughput?) to make its decision.
#### Process Creation 
* 启动步骤
> By loading the code and static data into memory, by creating and ini tializing a stack, and by doing other work as related to I/O setup, the OS
 has now (fifinally) set the stage for program execution. It thus has one last
 task: to start the program running at the entry point, namely main().
 >By jumping to the main() routine (through a specialized mechanism that
we will discuss next chapter), the OS transfers control of the CPU to the
newly-created process, and thus the program begins its execution.
* 为何现代的技术使用慢加载而不是快加载
  * 快加载将内容完全载入后才运行
  * 慢加载加载部分就运行
>To truly understand how lazy loading
 of pieces of code and data works, you’ll have to understand more about the machinery of paging and swapping
