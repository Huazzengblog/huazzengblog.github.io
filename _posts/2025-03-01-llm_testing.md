# llm-testing
## LISP（LLM Based Input Space Partitioning Testing for Library APIs）
### method
* Source code → Input space (Specification).
* Code + Specification → Mappings between parameters and constructor sequences used for instantiation.
* Specifications and selected constructors → Statements.

### Motivation:
* LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities.
* Cons in existing techniques:

  * Search-based testing:
    Generates a large amount of inputs that go through redundant program paths.
  * Symbolic execution:
    Requires heavy computational resources to solve path conditions.

### Evaluation:

* Code coverage:
    * Average code coverage.
    * Quality.
    * Efficiency.
* Usefulness:Exceptions & Vulnerabilities.
* Cost.
* Ablation Study.


### Limits and Future:

* Interpretability challenges.
* Complicated API interactions.
* Current reliance on drivers.
* Document-enhanced prompt engineering.

### Thinking:

* Semantic docs generated by LLM.
* LISP-CG (?).
* Testing oracles.
* "Do not interrupt the thought chain."
* Testing example factory.



## Do LLMs generate test oracles that capture the  actual or the expected program behaviour?
